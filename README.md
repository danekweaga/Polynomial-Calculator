# Polynomial Calculator

This Java application allows you to input, solve, and graph polynomial equations up to the third degree (cubic). 

## Features

- Supports linear, quadratic, and cubic equations.
- Shows real and complex roots.
- Graphs the polynomial visually using a dynamic LineChart.
- Built-in custom UI for typing expressions (no keyboard needed).
- Designed for laptops/desktops.

## Structure

- `MathLogic.java` – Handles equation parsing, formatting, and solving.
- `PolynomialGrapher.java` – Displays the graph using JavaFX.
- `PolynomialCalculatorGUI.java` – GUI layout for the calculator.
- `PolynomialCalculatorApp.java` – Entry point to launch the application.
