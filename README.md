## Features

- **Dark-themed UI** with rounded corners and responsive button feedback.
- **Custom number keypad** — no keyboard required.
- **Switch Sides** — toggle between LHS and RHS input using a single button.
- **Quick polynomial buttons** — insert `x`, `x²`, and `x³` with one tap.
- **Graph viewer** — plot and visualize polynomial functions in a separate window.
- **Image-based power button** — replaces traditional window controls for a sleek shutdown.
- **Accurate math engine** — built on a reliable `MathLogic` class backend.

## How to Run

### General (Any IDE)
1. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code).
2. Ensure **JavaFX** is properly set up (JavaFX SDK and VM options).
3. Run `PolynomialCalculatorApp.java` as the main class.

---

###  For BlueJ Users
1. Open the project folder in **BlueJ**.
2. Right-click the `PolynomialCalculatorApp` class.
3. Select **Run JavaFX Application** (from the package view).

 That’s it — the application should launch with full GUI support.

> Make sure BlueJ is set up to run JavaFX projects (JavaFX libraries and VM args may be needed).

## How to Use

1. Use the custom keypad to input both sides of your equation.
2. Tap **Switch Side** to alternate between LHS and RHS input fields.
3. Press `SOLVE` to compute the roots of the polynomial.
4. Press `GRAPH` to open a visual graph viewer.
5. Press `CLEAR` to reset both input fields and result display.
6. Click the **power icon** to exit the app.

> Equations must evaluate to 0. Example: `x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0`  
> `^` means *raised to the power*, e.g., `x^2` = x²
