## 🧮 How to Use

1. Use the custom keypad to input both sides of your equation.
2. Tap **Switch Side** to alternate between LHS and RHS input fields.
3. Press `SOLVE` to compute the roots of the polynomial.
4. Press `GRAPH` to open a visual graph viewer.
5. Press `CLEAR` to reset both input fields and result display.
6. Click the **power icon** to exit the app.

> ℹ️ Equations must evaluate to 0. Example: `x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0`  
> `^` means *raised to the power*, e.g., `x^2` = x²
